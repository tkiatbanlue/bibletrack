# BibleTrack Deployment Fix - Blank White Page Issue

## Problem
The BibleTrack application was showing a blank white page because:
1. The `homepage` property was missing from `package.json`
2. The JavaScript file names in `index.html` didn't match the actual files
3. There was a conflicting Apache site configuration

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update package.json (Already done)
Added `"homepage": "/bibletrack"` to package.json

### 2. Rebuild the application (Already done)
```bash
cd /home/admin/bibletrack
npm run build
```

### 3. Copy files to web directory (Run as root)
```bash
sudo cp -r /home/admin/bibletrack/build/* /var/www/html/bibletrack/
```

### 4. Disable conflicting site configuration (Run as root)
```bash
sudo a2dissite bibletrack.conf
```

### 5. Restart Apache (Run as root)
```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

## Verification Steps

1. Check that files are correctly deployed:
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/www/html/bibletrack/
   ls -la /var/www/html/bibletrack/static/js/
   ```

2. Check Apache configuration:
   ```bash
   apache2ctl -S
   ```

3. Check Apache error logs if issues persist:
   ```bash
   tail -n 20 /var/log/apache2/error.log
   ```
