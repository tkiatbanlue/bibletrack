# Fixing Firebase Progress Saving

## Issue Identified

The Firebase progress saving is not working because your application is missing Firebase Admin credentials. The Firestore security rules require proper authentication to write to the database, but your application doesn't have the necessary service account credentials.

## Solution

1. **Generate Firebase Service Account Key**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Save the JSON file securely

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id_from_json
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
YOUR_KEY_HERE
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email_from_json
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_json
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_CERT_URL=your_client_cert_url_from_json
   ```

3. **Alternative Solution (For Development Only)**
   Temporarily modify your Firestore rules in `firestore.rules`:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read/write access for development
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   ⚠️ **Warning:** Only use this for development. Never deploy these rules to production as they allow anyone to read/write to your database.

## Verification Steps

1. After adding the credentials, restart your development server
2. Log in to your application with a valid user account
3. Make changes to your Bible reading progress
4. Click "Save Progress"
5. Check the browser console for any errors
6. Verify data is saved in Firebase Firestore console

## Additional Notes

- The path references in your deployment scripts are normal and not causing the issue
- Your Firebase configuration in `src/firebase.js` is correct
- The Firestore security rules are properly configured but require authentication
