# Firebase Progress Saving Verification

## Steps to Verify the Fix

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   Run the following command to verify your environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   node test-env-variables.js
   ```

2. **Test Firebase Admin Authentication**
   Run the verification script to ensure Firebase Admin SDK works:
   ```bash
   node verify-firebase-fix.js
   ```

3. **Test Frontend Progress Saving**
   Start your React development server and test the progress saving feature in the browser:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Check Firebase Console**
   Visit your Firebase Console to verify data is being saved:
   - Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
   - Check the "progress" collection for new documents

## Expected Results

✅ Firebase Admin SDK should initialize without errors
✅ Progress documents should be created and retrieved successfully
✅ Data should appear in your Firebase Firestore console
✅ The React app should save progress when you check/uncheck chapters

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Double-check your .env file** - Ensure all required variables are present and correctly formatted
2. **Restart your development server** - Environment variables are only loaded when the server starts
3. **Check Firebase Console** - Verify your project is correctly configured and rules are deployed
4. **Check browser console** - Look for any JavaScript errors when saving progress

## Additional Notes

- The service account credentials allow server-side operations but don't affect frontend authentication
- Users still need to log in through the app for frontend operations to work
- Make sure to keep your service account credentials secure and never commit them to version control
