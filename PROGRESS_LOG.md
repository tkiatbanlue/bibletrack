   - Resolution: Moved firebase.js to src directory and updated import paths
   - Issue: Problems with WSL file paths and module resolution
   - Resolution: Used relative paths instead of aliases
2. React-scripts installation issues
   - Issue: "react-scripts: not found" during build
   - Resolution: Reinstalled react-scripts package
3. Checklist recording issues
   - Issue: Webapp not recording check marks
   - Resolution: Fixed chapter count calculation logic in handleChapterChange function
   - Resolution: Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the application
   - Resolution: Updated Firestore security rules to ensure proper write permissions
4. Checklist changes not saving
